# Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression

A Machine Learning project that leverages Logistic Regression to classify tumours as **Benign** or **Malignant**, aiming to assist in early detection and treatment strategies for breast cancer.

---

## Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Early detection and accurate classification significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project utilises Logistic Regression to predict the nature of tumours based on diagnostic features.

## Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and selecting key features.

2. **Train-Test Split**  
   - Split the data using Scikit-learnâ€™s `train_test_split` for unbiased model evaluation.

3. **Model Building**  
   - Developed a Logistic Regression model with Scikit-learn, trained on the processed data.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated model performance using accuracy score, achieving a final accuracy of **94%**.
